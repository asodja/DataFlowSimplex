# DataFlowSimplex
Simplex algorithm for the Maxeler data-flow computer architecture

There are four different implementations of the algorithm:
 - simplex-stream : streaming the data from the main memory, one element at a time.
 - simplex-stream-vec : streaming the data from the main memory as vectors.
 - simplex-lmem : streaming the data from LMEM, one element at a time.
 - simplex-lmem-vec : streaming the data from LMEM as vectors.
